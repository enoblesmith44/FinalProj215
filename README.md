I started this reasearch topic, because i was interested to see how Sea Surface Temperatures affect the incidence of Karenia brevis. My goal was to find a link OR find that there was no link between those two factors. After completing my research project, i can conlude that data supports my hypothesis that increased SST have a direct correlation with HAB Frequency.
